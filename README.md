The hardware involved in this project included the following: an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LILYGO-T-Display-Arduino-Development-CH9102F/dp/B099MPFJ9M?th=1">ESP32 TTGO T-display</a>, ten <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3101?gclid=Cj0KCQjw0tKiBhC6ARIsAAOXutmiu32D4X_OT_O9jRZb08zuguUAwx8xPmHqIJxUwAfb7TyfkgBVUAcaAqpwEALw_wcB">pushbuttons</a> (preferably soft/squishy ones), an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-LM386-Audio-Amplifier-Module/dp/B00LNACGTY">LM386 amplifier</a>, an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Uxcell-a15080600ux0275-Internal-Magnet-Speaker/dp/B0177ABRQ6/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=8+Ohm+Speakers&qid=1683555958&sr=8-3">8-ohm speaker</a>, a breadboard, and a good supply of wires. See the diagram below for details on how to wire the components together.

Choosing the correct ESP32 pins for the buttons might take some trial and errorâ€“for some reason, my GPIO pins 37,38,39 did not seem to work so I had to test out each pin until I had enough for all ten of the buttons. The amplifier also gave me some issues with the onboard potentiometer. I would recommend playing a tone and fidgeting with the potentiometer until the speaker is loud enough and not static-y.

ESP32 tone library: https://github.com/weedmanu/ToneESP32. I've also included the library folder (ToneESP32) above.
